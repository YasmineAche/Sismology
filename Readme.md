## Introduction

Seismology is the study of earthquakes and seismic waves. Python is a versatile programming language with a rich ecosystem of libraries, making it an excellent choice for analyzing and visualizing seismic data. This repository aims to provide a collection of Python programs and scripts that can be used for various seismology-related tasks.

## Programs

Here are some of the programs and scripts available in this repository:

- [EVT_to_Matlab_converter.py](EVT_to_Matlab_converter.py): This program converts seismic data in 'kinemetrics_evt' format to MATLAB .mat files using ObsPy and SciPy.

_Feel free to contribute by adding your own seismology-related Python programs._

## Requirements

Before using the programs in this repository, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in individual program README files)

You can install Python libraries using `pip` as needed.

## Usage

Each program in this repository comes with its own README file that explains how to use it. Please refer to the specific program's README for detailed usage instructions.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the seismology community! If you have Python programs or scripts related to seismology that you'd like to share, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contributions.
3. Add your programs or scripts to the repository.
4. Create a pull request.
